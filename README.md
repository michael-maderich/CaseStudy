Case Study for Per Scholas Philadelphia 2021

A Readme file gives the user(who visits your repository) a brief idea about what the project is about, which language it has used, what are the terms and conditions, licensing, how many forks/stars the repository has got, what your project can do, screenshots of your running application, etc

The scope of this project involves full development of an e-commerce website called â€œThe Little Store." The Little Store will be a web app designed to facilitate a simple retail operation dealing in various household goods.  It requires a front-end website which is used both by customers for browsing items and placing orders, and by managers for performing operations on the inventory and processing orders; it requires a back-end database to store product, order, and user details; and it requires an application to coordinate the front-end with the back-end, that performs operations on the database in response to actions performed on the website.
