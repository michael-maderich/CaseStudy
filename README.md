Case Study for Per Scholas Philadelphia 2021

The scope of this project involves full development of an e-commerce website called “The Little Store." The Little Store will be a web app designed to facilitate a simple retail operation dealing in various household goods.  It requires a front-end website which is used both by customers for browsing items and placing orders, and by managers for performing operations on the inventory and processing orders; it requires a back-end database to store product, order, and user details; and it requires an application to coordinate the front-end with the back-end, that performs operations on the database in response to actions performed on the website.
